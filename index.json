When deciding on these policies, it may therefore be important to correctly anticipate developments in inequality. In three large-scale experiments, I first demonstrate that people tend to underestimate how much inequality may increase in the presence of economic growth. Second, I show that biased perceptions of inequality may increase support for redistribution if subjects wrongly believe (i) that they will gain from tax-financed redistribution, or (ii) that redistribution comes at negligible personal costs. In general, however, underestimating inequality has no effect on subjects' preferences for redistribution. While informing subjects about the actual level of inequality increases their willingness to pay for redistribution, subjects who stand to lose from redistribution also realise that it comes at greater personal costs. These results suggest that it is inconsequential for policy support that most people underestimate future increases in inequality. Rather, what matters is whether individuals know whether redistribution is costly for themselves.","tags":["Social Preferences"],"title":"Growth and Inequality: Experimental Evidence on How Misperceptions Affect Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Markus Seier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"5737f8649500bb50b9f0d3b6803f11a0","permalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","section":"publication","summary":"In many Western countries, citizens have become increasingly biased in how they evaluate others based on political affiliation. This affective polarization harms the functioning of governments, and it is particularly detrimental in times of crisis. The present study investigates how Russia's invasion of Ukraine influences affective polarization in the U.S. In an online experiment, we first show that priming Americans with the threat of Russia's invasion reduces affective polarization as measured by a standard feeling thermometer. We then show that this measure is behaviorally relevant as it predicts subjects' willingness to compromise in an incentivized asymmetric Battle of the Sexes game. Finally, we find that the threat prime increases subjects' willingness to cooperate and compromise for the \"greater good\". Our findings have great implications for society as they demonstrate that while affective polarization undermines cooperation, citizens may come together when perceiving an external threat, which can be vital for the immediate policy response.","tags":["Social Preferences"],"title":"Did Russia's Invasion of Ukraine Reduce Affective Polarization in the U.S.?

In our setting, subjects either set a goal some days prior to an online task (early goal) or right at the start of the task (late goal). Two further treatments allow for (unanticipated) explicit revision of the early goal. Consistent with early goals being self-regulation tools, we observe that (i) early goals are larger than late goals; (ii) subjects in early goals treatments work more than those in the late goal treatment, despite evidence of substantial downward goal revision in the former. A secondary contribution of our paper is that our design addresses a treatment migration problem present in earlier studies on goals that stems from the fact that subjects in a `no goals' control condition may privately set goals.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Does Goal Revision Undermine Self-Regulation Through Goals?

Using a dictator game and a social dilemma game, that captures essential features of the public goods game, we replicate previous findings that economics students give significantly less than students from other disciplines. However, when subjects decide whether or not to punish a free rider, we find that economics students are just as likely to punish as students from other disciplines.","tags":["Economics Education"],"title":"Do Economists Punish Less?","type":"publication"}]
