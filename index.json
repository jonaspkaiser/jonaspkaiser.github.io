Citizens' support for such policies may therefore depend on their beliefs about how inequality will evolve over time. In three large-scale experiments, I examine how well individuals predict future inequality in the presence of economic growth, and I examine how beliefs about inequality matter for people's preferences for redistribution. I show that although most people underestimate future increases in inequality, this is inconsequential as beliefs about inequality do not influence preferences for redistribution. Rather, what matters is whether individuals know if redistribution is costly for themselves.","tags":["Social Preferences"],"title":"Growth and Inequality: Experimental Evidence on How Misperceptions Affect Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Markus Seier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"5737f8649500bb50b9f0d3b6803f11a0","permalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","section":"publication","summary":"In many countries, citizens have become increasingly biased in how they evaluate others based on political affiliation. We argue that this increase in affective polarization may in part be caused by changes in global power structures and the lack of external (military) threats. To test the importance of external threats, we conduct a priming experiment to examine how Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 causally influenced affective polarization and collaboration in the U.S. We find that making Russia's military aggression salient leads to a modest reduction in affective polarization and an increase in general cooperativeness. Surprisingly, this effect did not depend on perceived cross-party disagreement about the conflict. These results suggest that one must also look to global changes in international relations to understand within-country developments in polarization and willingness to collaborate.","tags":["Polarization","Social Preferences"],"title":"Do External Threats Reduce Affective Polarization?

In our setting, subjects either set a goal some days prior to an online task (early goal) or right at the start of the task (late goal). Two further treatments allow for (unanticipated) explicit revision of the early goal. Consistent with early goals being self-regulation tools, we observe that (i) early goals are larger than late goals; (ii) subjects in early goals treatments work more than those in the late goal treatment, despite evidence of substantial downward goal revision in the former. A secondary contribution of our paper is that our design addresses a treatment migration problem present in earlier studies on goals that stems from the fact that subjects in a `no goals' control condition may privately set goals.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Does Goal Revision Undermine Self-Regulation Through Goals?

Using a dictator game and a social dilemma game, that captures essential features of the public goods game, we replicate previous findings that economics students give significantly less than students from other disciplines. However, when subjects decide whether or not to punish a free rider, we find that economics students are just as likely to punish as students from other disciplines.","tags":["Economics Education"],"title":"Do Economists Punish Less?","type":"publication"}]
