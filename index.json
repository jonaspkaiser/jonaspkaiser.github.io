Our design addresses a treatment migration problem present in earlier studies on goals. Subjects either set a goal some days prior to an online task (early goal) or right at the start of the task (late goal). Consistent with early goals being self-regulation tools, we observe that (i) early goals are larger than late goals; (ii) subjects in early goals treatments work more than those in the late goal treatment, despite evidence of substantial downward goal revision in the former.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Does Goal Revision Undermine Self-Regulation Through Goals?

In doing so, I draw on the insight that when income or wealth grows exponentially, inequality grows exponentially as well. I find that when subjects face exponentially increasing inequality, they tend to underestimate how much inequality increases over time. Importantly, this also implies that well-off subjects underestimate their personal cost of redistribution. I find that these effects cancel out. Debiasing subjects increases their WTP for redistribution, but it does not change their preferred tax rate.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Growth and Inequality: How Exponential Growth Bias Distorts Preferences for Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Kasper S.

Using a dictator game and a social dilemma game, that captures essential features of the public goods game, we replicate previous findings that economics students give significantly less than students from other disciplines. However, when subjects decide whether or not to punish a free rider, we find that economics students are just as likely to punish as students from other disciplines.","tags":["Economics Education"],"title":"Do Economists Punish Less?","type":"publication"}]
