Understanding how inequality grows may in turn be important for making optimal decisions about policies that can equalise future outcomes. In three online experiments ($N=3,489$), I first demonstrate that people tend to underestimate how much inequality increases in the presence of growth. Second, I show that providing subjects with information about the actual level of future inequality generally has no effect on their preferences for redistribution in a tax-transfer scheme. Informed about greater inequality, net contributors become more willing to pay for redistribution. But they also realise that they incur a greater personal cost at a given tax rate when income differences are large. The greater cost offsets the greater concern for redistribution, leaving the tax rate unchanged. I thus find that the only cases in which information changes voting preferences are (i) when individuals wrongly believe that they gain from taxation, and (ii) when individuals wrongly believe that redistribution comes at negligible personal costs.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Growth and Inequality: How Exponential Growth Bias Distorts Preferences for Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Alexander K.

In our setting, subjects either set a goal some days prior to an online task (early goal) or right at the start of the task (late goal). Two further treatments allow for (unanticipated) explicit revision of the early goal. Consistent with early goals being self-regulation tools, we observe that (i) early goals are larger than late goals; (ii) subjects in early goals treatments work more than those in the late goal treatment, despite evidence of substantial downward goal revision in the former. A secondary contribution of our paper is that our design addresses a treatment migration problem present in earlier studies on goals that stems from the fact that subjects in a `no goals' control condition may privately set goals.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Does Goal Revision Undermine Self-Regulation Through Goals?

Using a dictator game and a social dilemma game, that captures essential features of the public goods game, we replicate previous findings that economics students give significantly less than students from other disciplines. However, when subjects decide whether or not to punish a free rider, we find that economics students are just as likely to punish as students from other disciplines.","tags":["Economics Education"],"title":"Do Economists Punish Less?","type":"publication"}]
