In this paper, we introduce a decomposition of signalling into its direct and indirect components. An observed behaviour can influence a person's image directly when the behaviour itself is image-relevant, and it can influence a person's image indirectly by changing people's beliefs about an unobserved, image-relevant behaviour. In an experiment on charitable giving, donors decide on (i) what charities to donate to, and (ii) how much to donate. We vary which of the donors' decisions are observed by a third-party. We find that individuals engage in wasteful, indirect signalling. They engage in a behaviour that in itself is not image-relevant (donating to many charities), but only if doing so can change observers' beliefs about an unobserved, image-relevant behaviour (donating large amounts). Avoiding wasteful signalling is key to designing effective institutions, and decision-makers therefore need to consider the two components of signalling.","tags":["Social Preferences","Social Norms"],"title":"Bluffing in Charitable Giving – An Experiment on Indirect Signalling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Alexander K.

In our setting, subjects either set a goal some days prior to an online task (early goal) or right at the start of the task (late goal). Two further treatments allow for (unanticipated) explicit revision of the early goal. We observe that (i) early goals are larger than late goals; (ii) subjects who set early goals work more than those who only set a late goal if they explicitly revise their goal and are reminded about their revised goal. A secondary contribution of our paper is that our design addresses a treatment migration problem present in earlier studies on goals that stems from the fact that subjects in a ‘no goals’ control condition may privately set goals.","tags":["Self-Regulation","Goals","Present Bias"],"title":"Does Goal Revision Undermine Self-Regulation Through Goals?

Yet, a large literature in cognitive psychology suggests that individuals often struggle to understand the effect of exponential growth. Failing to grasp how inequality develops may lead to biased preferences for policies with long-term effects, from taxation to investments in education. In an incentivised experiment, I examine (i) whether individuals are able to predict how exponential economic growth influences inequality, and (ii) whether informing individuals about the actual development of inequality influences their preferences for redistribution. I find that most people underestimate how much inequality increases in the presence of growth. However, informing individuals about the actual level of inequality does not affect their preferences for redistribution. Rather, what matters is whether people know if redistribution will come at a personal cost to themselves.","tags":["Social Preferences"],"title":"Growth and Inequality: How Does Correcting Misperceptions Affect Redistribution?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonas Pilgaard Kaiser","Markus Seier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1660089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660089600,"objectID":"5737f8649500bb50b9f0d3b6803f11a0","permalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/did-russias-invasion/","section":"publication","summary":"In many countries, partisans have become increasingly biased in how they evaluate others based on political affiliation. We suggest that this increase in affective polarization may in part be caused by changes in the global power distribution which caused many countries to experience a long period without external (military) threats. To study the importance of external threats, we conduct a priming experiment to examine how making Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 salient causally influences affective polarization and collaboration in the U.S. We find that priming Americans with Russia's military aggression leads to a modest reduction in affective polarization and an increase in cooperativeness as measured by behavior in an incentivized coordination game. Surprisingly, the effect of making Russia's invasion salient does not depend on perceived cross-party disagreement about the conflict. These results suggest that researchers should also consider international relations to understand within-country polarization and willingness to collaborate.","tags":["Polarization","Social Preferences"],"title":"Do External Threats Reduce Affective Polarization?

Using a dictator game and a social dilemma game, that captures essential features of the public goods game, we replicate previous findings that economics students give significantly less than students from other disciplines. However, when subjects decide whether or not to punish a free rider, we find that economics students are just as likely to punish as students from other disciplines.","tags":["Economics Education"],"title":"Do Economists Punish Less?","type":"publication"}]
